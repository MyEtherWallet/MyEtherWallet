MyEtherWallet is a doorway to the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to manage their own funds without a centralized platform. - <i>Stephen, #MEWForce</i>

## Philosophy

* <b>Empower the people</b>: Give people the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
* <b>Make it easy & free</b>: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ether & Tokens without additional cost.
* <b>People are the Priority</b>: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
* <b>A learning experience, too</b>: We want to educate about Ethereum, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ethereum and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
* <b>If it can be hacked, it will be hacked</b>: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
* <b>Offline / Client-Side</b>: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
* <b>Private</b>: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
* <b>Open source & auditable</b>

## Bug / Feature Request

If you find a bug, or want a new feature added, please submit it on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/issues)

## Getting started

1. Open terminal
2. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet.git`
3. go into repo: `cd MyEtherWallet`
4. run `git checkout develop`
5. run `npm ci` to install node packages.
6. run `npm update` and update packages indicated by the script or add the packages to `package-test.js`
7. run `npm run build:nohash` and open the `index.html` file within the `/dist` folder. You can also build the offline version by running `npm run build:offline` and opening the `index.html` file from the `/dist` folder with your preferred browser

### To start the local dev environment, follow everything above and skip step 7

1. start `npm run dev`
2. App should be running in `https://localhost:8080`

EACCESS issue can be resolved by running: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm`

For other issues, try the steps shown here: <https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/issues/1182#issuecomment-506342875> by @tomwalton78

For step 7, you may run into a memory heap problem, rerun the script using `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npm run build:nohash` or `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 npm run build:offline`
P.S if you want Intercom to be enabled locally, create a `.env` file and add `INTERCOM_ID={yourIntercomKey}` otherwise Intercom will be disabled.
