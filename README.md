MyEtherWallet is a doorway to the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to manage their own funds without a centralized platform. - <i>Stephen, #MEWForce</i>

## Philosophy

* <b>Empower the people</b>: Give people the ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
* <b>Make it easy & free</b>: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send Ether & Tokens without additional cost.
* <b>People are the Priority</b>: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
* <b>A learning experience, too</b>: We want to educate about Ethereum, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how Ethereum and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
* <b>If it can be hacked, it will be hacked</b>: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
* <b>Offline / Client-Side</b>: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
* <b>Private</b>: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
* <b>Open source & auditable</b>
