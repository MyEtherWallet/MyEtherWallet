              Welcome to MyEtherWallet, a free, open-source, client-side tool for interacting with the blockchain. MyEtherWallet, Inc. values privacy and we make a concerted effort to minimize and, to the extent possible, eliminate the exposure of personal data during the use of our interface. MyEtherWallet does not collect, hold, or store keys, account information, or passwords. We do not collect data passively, do not monetize the collection of data, and do not use your data for marketing or advertising.

              To the extent we collect any personal information, this privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how MyEtherWallet collects, uses, and shares personal information of people who visit our website (the “Site”), use our mobile application, MEWconnect (the “App”), or otherwise use our services (collectively, the “Services”).

              This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Services. Please read the Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By visiting the Site, App, and/or using the Services, you acknowledge that the collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.

              So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about an individual that (either by itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that individual to be identified, including, the individual’s name, telephone number, or e-mail address.

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Due to the inherent transparency of many blockchains, including the Ethereum Blockchain, transactions that individuals broadcast via MyEtherWallet may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address, the public address of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Information stored on a blockchain may be public, immutable, and difficult or even impossible to remove or delete. Transactions and addresses may reveal information about the user’s identity and information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. Users are encouraged to review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain works.
