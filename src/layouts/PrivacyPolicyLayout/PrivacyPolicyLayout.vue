            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>
              Welcome to MyEtherWallet, a free, open-source, client-side tool
              for interacting with the blockchain. MyEtherWallet, Inc. values
              privacy and we make a concerted effort to minimize and, to the
              extent possible, eliminate the exposure of personal data during
              the use of our interface. MyEtherWallet does not collect, hold, or
              store keys, account information, or passwords. We do not collect
              data passively, do not monetize the collection of data, and do not
              use your data for marketing or advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
              To the extent we collect any personal information, this privacy
              policy (“Policy”) describes how MyEtherWallet collects, uses, and
              shares personal information of people who visit our website (the
              “Site”), use our mobile applications, MEW wallet and MEWconnect
              (the “Apps”), or otherwise use our services (collectively, the
              “Services”).
            </p>
            <p>
              This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Services. Please
              read the Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding
              your information and how we will treat it. By visiting the Site,
              Apps, and/or using the Services, you acknowledge that the
              collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place
              as described in this Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we
              use the phrase “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
              mean information about an individual that (either by itself or
              when combined with information from other available sources)
              allows that individual to be identified, including, the
              individual’s name, telephone number, or e-mail address.
            </p>
            <h3>THE BLOCKCHAIN</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the inherent transparency of many blockchains, including
              the Ethereum Blockchain, transactions that individuals broadcast
              via MyEtherWallet may be publicly accessible. This includes, but
              is not limited to, your public sending address, the public address
              of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a
              user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Information
              stored on a blockchain may be public, immutable, and difficult or
              even impossible to remove or delete. Transactions and addresses
              may reveal information about the user’s identity and information
              can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party
              who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. Users are
              encouraged to review how privacy and transparency on the
              blockchain works.
            </p>
            <h3>WHAT WE COLLECT</h3>
            <p>
              We collect information about you as described below. We use this
              information to enhance your experience with our Services.
            </p>
            <h4>Information You Provide</h4>
            <p>
              We may collect Personal Information you choose to provide to us.
              For example, when you contact us for support through the Services,
              you give us with your e-mail address and any other information
              that you choose to provide. Also, if you participate in a
              MyEtherWallet offer, give-away, or promotion (“Promotion”), you
              provide your name, e-mail address, and mailing address.
            </p>
            <h4>California Do Not Track Disclosures</h4>
            <p>
              MyEtherWallet does not track users over time and across third
              party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does
              not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
            </p>
            <h3>USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
              We use the information that we have about you to provide support
              and certain Services to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may use the Personal Information we collect from and about you
              to (1) provide you with information or services that you request
              from us, including to respond to your comments, questions, and/or
              provide customer service; (2) monitor and analyze usage and trends
              and personalize and improve the Services and your experience using
              the Services; and (3) for any other purpose with your consent.
            </p>
            <h3>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

              described below, and we do not and will not sell your Personal
              Information to anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may share the Personal Information we collect from and about
              you (1) to fulfill the purpose for which you provided it; (2) with
              your consent; (3) for legal, protection, and safety purposes; (4)
              to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including
              to respond to any government or regulatory request; (5) to protect
              the rights of MyEtherWallet, our agents, customers, and others,
              including by enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of
              service; and (6) with those who need it to do work for us (our
              Service Providers, as defined below).
            </p>
            <h3>Service providers</h3>
            <p>
              We may contract with third parties to perform functions related to
              the Services (“Service Providers”). In general, Service Providers
              will have access to your Personal Information only to the extent
              needed to perform their business functions but may not use or
              share that personal information for purposes outside the scope of
              their functions related to the Services.
            </p>
            <h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
            <p>
              The Services contain links to other third-party websites or
              applications. Once you click on such a link and leave the Site or
              are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no
              longer governed by this Policy. Any information you provide on
              those sites is subject to that third party’s privacy policy and we
              are not responsible for the privacy and security practices and
              policies of those third-party sites or applications.
            </p>
            <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TOWARDS CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>
            <p>
              We do not direct the Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any
              Personal Information from children under 13. Children under 13 are
              not eligible to use the Services. If we learn that someone using
              our Services is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to
              remove any Personal Information from our database and to prevent
              them from utilizing the Services.
            </p>
            <h3>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION & RIGHTS</h3>
            <p>
              We are committed to protecting the security of Personal
              Information. We have taken certain physical, administrative, and
              technical steps to help safeguard the information we collect from
              and about you. While we take steps to help ensure the integrity
              and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee our
              security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              In certain circumstances, you will also have the following rights:
            </p>
            <p>

              cost, but for any further copies, we reserve the right to charge a

              withdraw that consent and the right to request that we delete or
              erase your Personal Information from our systems (however, this

              for compliance with any legal obligation, or if we require the
              information to establish or defend any legal claim);
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Right to restriction of use of your information: the right to

              5. Right to data portability: the right to request that we return
              any information you have provided in a structured, commonly used,

            </p>
            <p>
              6. Right to object: the right to object to our use of your

            <p>
              1. We rely on an individual’s consent to process Personal
              Information to provide support and/or carry out Promotions. This
              consent can be withdrawn at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. We also process the information provided by an individual in
              our legitimate interests in ensuring our business is conducted

              your request, provide support, and/or carry out and fulfill our
              Promotions. If you request support, we will retain your
              information for no longer than six (6) months. If you participate

              Promotion is carried out and ninety (90) days after any prize,
              reward, or offer is fulfilled. Your Personal Information will then
              be deleted.
