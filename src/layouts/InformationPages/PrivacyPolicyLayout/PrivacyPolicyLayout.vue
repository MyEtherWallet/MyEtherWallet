            are not &quot;web wallets&quot;. You do not create an account or
            give us your funds to hold onto. No data leaves your computer / your

            We are not responsible for any loss: Ethereum, MyEtherWallet.com
            &amp; MyEtherWallet CX, and some of the underlying Javascript
            libraries we use are under active development. While we have
            thoroughly tested &amp; tens of thousands of wallets have been
            successfully created by people all over the globe, there is always
            the possibility something unexpected happens that causes your funds
            to be lost. Please do not invest more than you are willing to lose,
            and please be careful.
