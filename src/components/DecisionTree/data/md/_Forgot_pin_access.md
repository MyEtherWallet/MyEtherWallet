## Forgot pin (MEW wallet)

#### If you're having trouble remembering your pin and can't access through biometric signature (such as fingerprint or FaceID), follow these steps:

1. Please go through the recovery process to restore your wallet with the 24 word mnemonic phrase that was provided when backing up your wallet.

2. If you did not back up your wallet, there is no way to recover it.

3. <p>If your mnemonic phrase is not working in the app or on our website, please make sure that you try all of the steps outlined below:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Check each word against <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt">the complete list of words</a> used in mnemonic phrases. You may be spelling one wrong.</li>
     <li>Make sure you’re listing the words in the correct order.</li>
   </ul>

4. Still doesn’t help? Unfortunately, there is no way for us to recover this phrase for you. But feel free to reach out to us with more information.
