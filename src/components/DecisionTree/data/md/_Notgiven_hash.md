If they cannot provide one..

1. The transaction I’m looking for is in this list

   * If the explorer is showing the transaction as a success, please refer to the previous section **"I was given a transaction hash"**.

2. The transaction I’m looking for is not in this list

   * Your transaction never posted, it did not make it through.
   * Please check with the sending wallet as to why the transaction didn't make it.
