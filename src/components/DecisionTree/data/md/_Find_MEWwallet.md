## Using MEW wallet

#### After unlocking your MEW wallet account, you'll see a colorful account card near the top of your app.

**Click the down arrow on this card to view and copy your account address.**

Other names for your account address:

* Public address
* Public key
* Receiving address

This address is 42 characters long and begins with an '0x'. This is all that's necessary to receive any Ethereum assets to your account, such as ETH or tokens. All funds can be sent to the same singular address, or you can make more for account management.

If this doesn't help, please reach out with the contact form below.
