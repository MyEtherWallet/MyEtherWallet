## Using a Private Key

#### If your private key is leading to a different address on our site, please try all of the steps outlined below:

1. Make sure all 64 characters of your private key are correct. Even one wrong key will result in a different wallet.
2. Search your computer for a ‘UTC’ file that you might have made when generating your wallet for the first time. It will require a password, so make your best guess.
3. If that doesn’t solve your issue, reach out to us with as much info as possible about your situation. **But do not send us your private key!**

**Please keep in mind we cannot recover private keys.**
