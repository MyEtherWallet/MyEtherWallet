## Using MEWconnect

#### If you're having trouble using your mobile camera to scan the QR code, try these steps:

1. Make sure that your MEWconnect app is updated to its most recent version, and that the camera on your smartphone is clean. Also, check your phone permissions to confirm that the app is allowed to access the camera.
2. If that doesnâ€™t help, please send us as much information as possible so that we can get an accurate picture of the issue.
