## Using a Mnemonic Phrase Created on MEW web

#### If your mnemonic phrase is leading to different addresses on our site, please try all of the steps outlined below:

1. If you created a phrase with a password, make sure you include the password you created the phrase with.
2. If you’re including a password but still seeing the wrong addresses, try leaving the password out of your phrase.
3. Make sure you’re listing the words in the correct order.
4. If that doesn’t solve your issue, it’s likely your phrase is wrong, in which case there is nothing we can do. If you disagree, feel free to reach out to us with as much info as possible about your situation. **But do not send us your mnemonic phrase!**
