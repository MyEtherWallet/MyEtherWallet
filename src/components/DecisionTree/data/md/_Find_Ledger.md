## Using a Ledger

#### If you're having trouble finding your wallet's address on your Ledger device, read the following tips:

1. Ledger Live uses a different derivation path than MEW, causing different addresses to be generated when you connect it to either.
   * MEW V5 supports Ledger Live as a derivation path, so you can always connect directly by choosing the 'Ledger Live' path when connecting.
   * If you need further explanation about HD paths, feel free to [read our Medium article](https://medium.com/myetherwallet/hd-wallets-and-derivation-paths-explained-865a643c7bf2).
2. Make sure you’re using a recommended browser, such as  Brave or Google Chrome.
3. Confirm that you have the latest firmware upgrade for your Ledger, and that the Ethereum app on your device is also on it’s latest version. (This can be checked via Ledger Live.)
4. If that doesn’t solve your issue, reach out to us with as much info as possible about your situation.
