## Using a Mnemonic Phrase

#### If your mnemonic phrase is not working on our site, please try all of the steps outlined below:

1. Check each word against [the complete list of words](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) used in mnemonic phrases. You may be spelling one wrong.
2. Make sure you’re listing the words in the correct order.
3. Check the phrase against the original wallet you generated it from (MEWconnect, MetaMask, etc). If you generated it on MEW, ignore this step.
4. If that doesn’t solve your issue, it’s likely your phrase is wrong, in which case there is nothing we can do. If you disagree, feel free to reach out to us with as much info as possible about your situation. <strong>But do not send us your mnemonic phrase!</strong>
