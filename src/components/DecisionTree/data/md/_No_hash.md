## I Do Not Have My Transaction Hash

#### Search your public address on Etherscan.io to find your most recent transactions.

It’s possible one of these is the transaction you’re looking for. This is how you will find the transaction hash.

***

#### 1. The transaction I’m looking for is in this list

* If the explorer is showing the transaction as a success, please reach out to the receiving wallet as to why you can’t see your funds.

***

#### 2. The transaction I’m looking for is not in this list

* Your transaction never posted, it did not make it through.
* Try again with a higher gas price & limit.
