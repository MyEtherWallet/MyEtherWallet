      XinFin Walletis not a web wallet. You don't have a login, and nothing ever
      gets saved to our servers. It is simply an interface that allows you to
      interact with the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If XinFin Wallet goes down, you would have to find another way (like geth
      or XinFin Wallet / Mist) to do what we are doing. But you wouldn't have to
      "get" your Ether out ofXinFin Walletbecause it's not in XinFin Wallet.
      It's in whatever wallet your generated via our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can import your unencrypted private key and your Geth/Mist Format
      (encrypted) files directly into geth / XinFin Wallet / Mist very easily.
