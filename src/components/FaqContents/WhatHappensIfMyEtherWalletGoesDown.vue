    <p>
      MyEtherWallet is not a web wallet. You don't have a login, and nothing ever
      gets saved to our servers. It is simply an interface that allows you to
      interact with the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If MyEtherWallet.com goes down, you would have to find another way
      (like geth or Ethereum Wallet / Mist) to do what we are doing. But you wouldn't
      have to "get" your Ether out of MyEtherWallet because it's not in MyEtherWallet.
      It's in whatever wallet your generated via our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can import your unencrypted private key and your Geth/Mist Format
      (encrypted) files directly into geth / Ethereum Wallet / Mist very easily.
    </p>

      You can also run
      <a href="https://kb.myetherwallet.com/offline/running-myetherwallet-locally.html">
        MyEtherWallet locally
      </a>
      and/or
      <a href="https://kb.myetherwallet.com/networks/run-your-own-node-with-myetherwallet.html">
        connect it to your own node
      </a>.
