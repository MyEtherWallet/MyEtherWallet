      Decrypting the keystore files is an intensive process and
      doesn't enjoy being done in Javascript. We recommend...
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Using Google Chrome</li>
      <li>Clicking "continue" when you see the unresponsive error alert pop up</li>
      <li>
        Making sure you don't have other intensive programs open
        (a lot of browser tabs, video games, etc.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The combination of the above typically eliminate the problem.
      If it doesn't, please contact us with your browser and OS and
      we can advise from there.
