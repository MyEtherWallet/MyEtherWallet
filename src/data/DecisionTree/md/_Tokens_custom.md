## Adding Custom Tokens

#### If you see your tokens on EthVM but not on MEW, you may need to [add them as a custom token](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/tokens/how-to-add-custom-token/).

##### If you are using MEWconnect, you will need to connect to the web-based MEW wallet in order to see your custom tokens.
