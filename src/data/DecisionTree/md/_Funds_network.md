## Expecting Non-Ethereum Funds

#### Using a Ledger Wallet

**Ledger uses a different derivation path and application on the device for each separate blockchain.** 

    - Please make sure you are connected to the correct app on your Ledger and the correct network on MEW (in the upper right-hand corner of your wallet dashboard).

#### Using Another Wallet

**1. When I access my wallet, I can change the network in the upper right-hand corner of my wallet dashboard.**

    - Please make sure you are connected to the correct network on MEW.

**2. When I access my wallet, I cannot change the network in the upper right-hand corner of my wallet dashboard.** 

    - Access MEW offline through your recovery method (mnemonic phrase or private key) to connect to the appropriate network. 
      - This should allow you to interact with your funds. 


    - Use a blockchain-appropriate explorer for an accurate depiction of your holdings, like gastracker.io for ETC funds.
