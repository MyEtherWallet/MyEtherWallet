## Using a Private Key

#### If your private key is not working on our site, please try all of the steps outlined below:

1. Make sure you’re including all 64 characters of your private key.
2. Make sure all your private key characters are in hexadecimal format, which means they fall between letters ‘a - f’ and numbers ‘0 - 9’.
3. If that doesn’t solve your issue, reach out to us with as much info as possible about your situation. **But do not send us your private key!**
