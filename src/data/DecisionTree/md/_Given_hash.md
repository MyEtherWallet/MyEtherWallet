## I Was Given a Transaction Hash

#### Search your hash on Etherscan.io

1. It says ‘Not Found’

   - Your transaction never posted, it did not make it through.
     Try again with a higher gas price & limit.

2. It says it ‘Failed’

   - Because I ran **‘Out of Gas’**
     - ETH is required for all transactions in the form of gas. 
     - We recommend having .01 ETH to cover this cost. 

   - Because of **‘Insufficient Funds’**
     - You did not allow a high enough gas limit from your sending wallet. 
     - Try raising your gas limit to 100,000 and sending the transaction again. 
     - Excess gas will not be used by the transaction.

   - Because it was **‘Reverted’**
     - When a transaction gives the 'Reverted' error code, it is referring to an issue with the contract itself. 
     - This is unrelated to MEW. 
       - Either you are trying to do something that the contract does not support, or the contract itself is the cause. 
     - We are not affiliated with any tokens or contracts, so if you receive this error please reach out to the support team for the token contract. Links for token support teams can usually be found via Etherscan.io or through a google search. (Make sure you're on the right websites, because there are a lot of fake phishing sites out there!).

   - It says **‘Success’**
     - If the explorer is showing the transaction as a success, it’s likely that you need to [add your funds as a custom token](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/tokens/how-to-add-custom-token/). 
     - If you’re looking for ETH, double-check the address and try connecting to other ETH networks.
