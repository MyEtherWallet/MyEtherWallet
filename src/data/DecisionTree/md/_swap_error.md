## There's an Error When I Try to Swap

#### Refer to this list of common errors and solutions.

1. ‘Invalid Address’

   - MEW only supports Ethereum-related crypto transactions. 
   - If you’re swapping for a non-Ethereum asset, you will need to provide a non-Ethereum address from a different wallet.

2. ‘Not Checksummed’

   - <p>The checksum version of your address is the version that includes both capital and lowercase letters, for accuracy.</p>
     <strong>The address itself is not different.</strong>
   - You can find this version by searching your address on Etherscan.io.

3. ‘Out of Gas’ or ‘Insufficient funds’

   - All transactions on the Ethereum blockchain require ETH for the fuel to make transactions happen, including swaps. 
   - We recommend having at least .01 ETH to cover this cost.

4. Unintelligible Error / Other
