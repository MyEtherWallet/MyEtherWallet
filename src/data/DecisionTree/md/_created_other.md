## Using a Mnemonic Phrase Created Elsewhere

#### If your mnemonic phrase is leading to different addresses on our site, please try all of the steps outlined below:

1. If you’re including a password, try leaving the password out of your phrase.
   <br>
2. If you’re not including a password, try to recall if you created the phrase with a password. 
   <br>
3. Make sure you’re listing the words in the correct order.
   <br>
4. Check the phrase against the original wallet you generated it from (MEWconnect, MetaMask, etc.).
   <br>
5. If that doesn’t solve your issue, it’s likely your phrase is wrong, in which case there is nothing we can do. If you disagree, feel free to reach out to us with as much info as possible about your situation. **But do not send us your mnemonic phrase!**
