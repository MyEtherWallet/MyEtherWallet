In order to keep Bitcoin in MyEtherWallet, you can swap to wrapped Bitcoin instead. Wrapped Bitcoin is an Ethereum token, with a value approximately equal to 1 BTC. Wrapped Bitcoins can be stored in MEW, and can be used as any other Ethereum asset: you can swap it to other tokens, use it as collateral in DeFi apps, etc. There are multiple kinds of wrapped Bitcoins, but they roughly do the same thing. \"),_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":_vm.getArticle('mv-btc-to-eth-mew-swap'),\"target\":\"_blank\"}},[_vm._v(\" Learn more about Wrapped Bitcoin. \")])]),_c('v-row',{staticClass:\"mt-6\"},[_c('v-col',{attrs:{\"cols\":\"12\",\"md\":\"4\"}},[_c('mew-button',{attrs:{\"btn-size\":\"small\",\"btn-style\":\"outline\",\"title\":\"Swap to renBTC\",\"has-full-width\":true},nativeOn:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.swapTo('renBTC')}}})],1),_c('v-col',{attrs:{\"cols\":\"12\",\"md\":\"4\"}},[_c('mew-button',{attrs:{\"btn-size\":\"small\",\"btn-style\":\"outline\",\"title\":\"Swap to wBTC\",\"has-full-width\":true},nativeOn:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.swapTo('wBTC')}}})],1),_c('v-col',{attrs:{\"cols\":\"12\",\"md\":\"4\"}},[_c('mew-button',{attrs:{\"btn-size\":\"small\",\"btn-style\":\"outline\",\"title\":\"Swap to PBTC\",\"has-full-width\":true},nativeOn:{\"click\":function($event){return _vm.swapTo('PBTC')}}})],1)],1)],1)],1)],1)],1)]):_vm._e(),(_vm.hasMinEth)?_c('div',[(_vm.showAnimation)?_c('v-slide-y-transition',{attrs:{\"hide-on-leave\":\"\",\"group\":\"\"}},[_c('swap-provider-mentions',{key:\"showAnimation\",attrs:{\"is-loading\":_vm.isLoadingProviders,\"check-loading\":_vm.checkLoading},on:{\"showProviders\":_vm.showProviders}})],1):_c('div',{key:\"showAnimation1\"},[_c('swap-providers-list',{class:_vm.isFromNonChain ?
