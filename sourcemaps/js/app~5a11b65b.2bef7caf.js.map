In order to keep Bitcoin in MyEtherWallet, you can swap to wrapped Bitcoin instead. Wrapped Bitcoin is an Ethereum token, with a value approximately equal to 1 BTC. Wrapped Bitcoins can be stored in MEW, and can be used as any other Ethereum asset: you can swap it to other tokens, use it as collateral in DeFi apps, etc. There are multiple kinds of wrapped Bitcoins, but they roughly do the same thing. \"),_c('a',{attrs:{\"href\":\"https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/5461528-move-your-btc-to-the-ethereum-blockchain-with-mew-swap\",\"target\":\"_blank\"}},[_vm._v(\" Learn more about Wrapped Bitcoin. \")])]),_c('v-row',{staticClass:\"mt-6\"},[_c('v-col',{attrs:{\"cols\":\"12\",\"md\":\"4\"}},[_c('mew-button',{attrs:{\"btn-size\":\"small\",\"btn-style\":\"outline\",\"title\":\"Swap to renBTC\",\"has-full-width\":true}})],1),_c('v-col',{attrs:{\"cols\":\"12\",\"md\":\"4\"}},[_c('mew-button',{attrs:{\"btn-size\":\"small\",\"btn-style\":\"outline\",\"title\":\"Swap to wBTC\",\"has-full-width\":true}})],1),_c('v-col',{attrs:{\"cols\":\"12\",\"md\":\"4\"}},[_c('mew-button',{attrs:{\"btn-size\":\"small\",\"btn-style\":\"outline\",\"title\":\"Swap to PBTC\",\"has-full-width\":true}})],1)],1)],1)],1)],1)],1)]):_vm._e(),(_vm.hasMinEth)?_c('div',[_c('v-slide-y-transition',{attrs:{\"hide-on-leave\":\"\",\"group\":\"\"}},[(_vm.showAnimation)?_c('swap-provider-mentions',{key:\"showAnimation\",attrs:{\"is-loading\":_vm.isLoadingProviders,\"check-loading\":_vm.checkLoading},on:{\"showProviders\":_vm.showProviders}}):_c('div',{key:\"showAnimation1\"},[_c('swap-providers-list',{staticClass:\"mt-7\",attrs:{\"step\":_vm.step,\"available-quotes\":_vm.availableQuotes,\"set-provider\":_vm.setProvider,\"to-token-symbol\":_vm.toTokenType ?

In order to keep\n                      Bitcoin in MyEtherWallet, you can swap to wrapped Bitcoin\n                      instead. Wrapped Bitcoin is an Ethereum token, with a\n                      value approximately equal to 1 BTC. Wrapped Bitcoins can\n                      be stored in MEW, and can be used as any other Ethereum\n                      asset: you can swap it to other tokens, use it as\n                      collateral in DeFi apps, etc. There are multiple kinds of\n                      wrapped Bitcoins, but they roughly do the same thing.\n                      <a\n
