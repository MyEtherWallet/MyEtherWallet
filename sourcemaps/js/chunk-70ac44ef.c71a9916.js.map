In order to keep\n                      Bitcoin in MyEtherWallet, you can swap to wrapped Bitcoin\n                      instead. Wrapped Bitcoin is an Ethereum token, with a\n                      value approximately equal to 1 BTC. Wrapped Bitcoins can\n                      be stored in MEW, and can be used as any other Ethereum\n                      asset: you can swap it to other tokens, use it as\n                      collateral in DeFi apps, etc. There are multiple kinds of\n                      wrapped Bitcoins, but they roughly do the same thing.\n                      <a\n                        :href=\"getArticle('mv-btc-to-eth-mew-swap')\"\n                        target=\"_blank\"\n                      >\n                        Learn more about Wrapped Bitcoin.\n                      </a>\n                    </div>\n                    <v-row class=\"mt-6\">\n                      <v-col cols=\"12\" md=\"4\">\n                        <mew-button\n                          btn-size=\"small\"\n                          btn-style=\"outline\"\n                          title=\"Swap to renBTC\"\n                          :has-full-width=\"true\"\n                          @click.native=\"swapTo('renBTC')\"\n                        />\n                      </v-col>\n                      <v-col cols=\"12\" md=\"4\">\n                        <mew-button\n                          btn-size=\"small\"\n                          btn-style=\"outline\"\n                          title=\"Swap to wBTC\"\n                          :has-full-width=\"true\"\n                          @click.native=\"swapTo('wBTC')\"\n                        />\n                      </v-col>\n                      <v-col cols=\"12\" md=\"4\">\n                        <mew-button\n                          btn-size=\"small\"\n                          btn-style=\"outline\"\n                          title=\"Swap to PBTC\"\n                          :has-full-width=\"true\"\n                          @click.native=\"swapTo('PBTC')\"\n                        />\n                      </v-col>\n                    </v-row>\n                  </v-expansion-panel-content>\n                </v-expansion-panel>\n              </v-expansion-panels>\n            </div>\n          </app-user-msg-block>\n\n          <!--\n            =====================================================================================\n             Providers List\n            =====================================================================================\n            -->\n          <div v-if=\"hasMinEth\">\n            <v-slide-y-transition v-if=\"showAnimation\" hide-on-leave group>\n              <swap-provider-mentions\n                key=\"showAnimation\"\n                :is-loading=\"isLoadingProviders\"\n                :check-loading=\"checkLoading\"\n                @showProviders=\"showProviders\"\n              />\n            </v-slide-y-transition>\n            <div v-else key=\"showAnimation1\">\n              <swap-providers-list\n                :step=\"step\"\n                :available-quotes=\"availableQuotes\"\n                :set-provider=\"setProvider\"\n                :to-token-symbol=\"toTokenType ? toTokenType.symbol : ''\"\n                :to-token-icon=\"toTokenType ? toTokenType.img : ''\"\n                :is-loading=\"isLoadingProviders\"\n                :providers-error=\"providersErrorMsg\"\n                :class=\"isFromNonChain ?
