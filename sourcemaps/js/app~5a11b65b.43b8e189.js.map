In order to keep\n                      Bitcoin in MyEtherWallet, you can swap to wrapped Bitcoin\n                      instead. Wrapped Bitcoin is an Ethereum token, with a\n                      value approximately equal to 1 BTC. Wrapped Bitcoins can\n                      be stored in MEW, and can be used as any other Ethereum\n                      asset: you can swap it to other tokens, use it as\n                      collateral in DeFi apps, etc. There are multiple kinds of\n                      wrapped Bitcoins, but they roughly do the same thing.\n                      <a\n
