Before\n                either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to\n                the other party a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\")\n                describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the\n                requested relief. A Notice to MyEtherWallet should be sent\n                to:724 S. Spring St., #1103, Los Angeles, CA 90014, Attention:\n                Legal. After the Notice is received, you and MyEtherWallet may\n                attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and\n                MyEtherWallet do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days\n                after the Notice is received, either party may begin an\n                arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made\n                by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after\n                the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any,\n                to which either party is entitled.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.3 Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through\n                the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), an established\n                alternative dispute resolution provider (\"ADR Provider\") that\n                offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not\n                available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an\n                alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall\n                govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not\n                limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding\n                arbitration, except to the extent such rules conflict with the\n                Terms of Service. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules\n                (\"Arbitration Rules\") governing the arbitration are available\n                online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\n                The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral\n                arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the\n                award sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars (US\n                $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based\n                arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For\n                claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is\n                ten thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to\n                a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any\n                hearing will be held in the city of Los Angeles, California,\n                unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award\n                rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of\n                competent jurisdiction.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.4 Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If\n                non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be\n                conducted by telephone, online, and/or based solely on written\n                submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party\n                initiating the arbitration.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.5 Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the\n                arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of\n                you and MyEtherWallet, and the dispute will not be consolidated\n                with any other matters or joined with any other cases or\n                parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant\n                motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator\n                shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant\n                any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual\n                under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms of Service.\n                The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of\n                decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on\n                which the award is based, including the calculation of any\n                damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award\n                relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law\n                would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding\n                upon you and MyEtherWallet.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR\n                CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A\n                TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all\n                claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this\n                Arbitration Agreement, excluding claims for injunctive or other\n                equitable relief as set forth below. Arbitration procedures are\n                typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than\n                court proceedings and are subject to very limited review by a\n                court. If any litigation should arise between you and\n                MyEtherWallet in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate\n                or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND\n                MYETHERWALLET WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing\n                that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.7 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.

If any part or parts of this Arbitration\n                Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable\n                by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or\n                parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and\n                the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in\n                full force and effect.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.9 Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set\n                forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party\n                against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive\n                or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.10 Survival of Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either\n                you or MyEtherWallet may bring an individual action in small\n                claims court.\n              </p>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                9.12 Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either\n                party may seek equitable relief before a court of competent\n                jurisdiction for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights,\n                trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents or\n                emergency equitable relief before a court of competent\n                jurisdiction to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A\n                request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any\n                other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <br /><br />\n            <div class=\"content\">\n              <h3>10.
